# McDonald-Food-case-study
## Project Overview
This project is a case study that involves analyzing McDonald's food data using both R and Python. The goal is to convert various statistical and machine learning operations performed in R to their equivalent in Python, ensuring the same analyses and visualizations can be replicated.

## Data Overview
Dataset: The dataset used in this case study (referred to as mcdonalds) consists of customer ratings on a scale from I hate it! to I love it!. These ratings are analyzed to understand customer preferences and segment them into different groups.
## Tools and Libraries
R:

flexclust, flexmix: For clustering and model-based clustering.
ggplot2: For visualization.
stats: For various statistical operations.
Python:

pandas: For data manipulation.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For plotting and visualization.
sklearn: For clustering (KMeans) and PCA.
